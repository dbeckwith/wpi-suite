		<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker">
		"Planning poker is a tool for estimating software development projects. It is a technique that minimizes effect of ANCHORING by asking each team member to play their estimate card such that it cannot be seen by the other players. After each player has selected a card, all cards are exposed at once."
