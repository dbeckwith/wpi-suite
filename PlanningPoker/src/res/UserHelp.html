		<h3>
			<a name="what">1.1 What is Planning Poker?</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Planning Poker is a tool for estimating requirements of
			development projects or subsets of the project. This software allows
			a team to reach a consensus for an estimate, an approximation of a
			relative amount of time needed to complete each requirement.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<h3>
			<a name="how">1.2 How Does Planning Poker Work?</a>
		</h3>
		<p>A Planning Poker session is typically created when a customer
			or developer feels that a new specification is needed to add
			functionality, usability, reliability, performance, and/or
			supportability to the product. A moderator can begin a Planning Poker
			session by starting a new game and adding requirements needed for
			estimation. Team members are then invited to vote their estimates in
			each requirement. The vote is not shown to other players until the
			session ends. When all users have voted and the session is closed,
			the team is now allowed to see every vote and discuss the estimates.
			A consensus is reached and the final estimate is entered. This allows
			for fairness of answers and for each team member to independently
			choose their estimate without any bias and influence from other
			players.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<h3>
			<a name="benefit">1.3 Benefits of Planning Poker</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Planning Poker is used to force each team member to think
			independently and for the entire team to view every team member’s
			estimates simultaneously. At times, if an individual says their
			number first, other members might follow their estimate. At other
			times, an individual might not listen to other people’s estimates and
			opinions because they think that their estimate is final. Planning
			Poker can be used in teams with difficulty expressing every member’s
			opinions and teams who have members with different personalities.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<h3>
			<a name="users">2.2 Users</a>
		</h3>
		<p>A user’s moderation privileges are game dependent. A game’s
			Moderator is the creator of the game. A moderator has access to
			controls to begin the game, end the game, and set the final
			estimation for each requirement of the game. All other users only
			have access to view and vote on the requirements of the game.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>
			<a name="panel">2.3 Overview of the Game Tree Pane</a>
		</h3>
		<p>On the game panel, the left side of the window shows a tree
			view of the games. There are three main groups of games: Games in
			Progress, Complete Games, and Closed Games. The first group has two types
			of games, while the second two groups only have one type of game:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Games in Progress:
				<ul>
					<li>Games marked with the icon of a blank page with a plus
						sign in the top corner have not been started yet are. They are
						still editable before they start.</li>
					<li>Games marked with an hourglass have been started and are
						available to be voted on.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Completed Games:
				<ul>
					<li>Games in this section can no longer be voted on by users.
						The moderator of a completed game has the option to set final
						estimates for each requirement and update the Requirement
						Manager to reflect these requirements.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Closed Games:
				<ul>
					<li>Games in this section are completed, but they can no longer
					be changed in any way. These games can be viewed for historical 
					purposes.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		</ul>

				through all the steps from creating to ending a game.</li>
